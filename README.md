The jupyter notebook is the file, where you create the model and train it. the idea is very similar to [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/train-your-own-chess-ai-66b9ca8d71e4) <br>
In the user input we only use the current positions, whose turn i is, and the current point evaluation of the position <br>
in the other files "create_dataset" you can create a database with position and its evaluation using a [lichess database file](https://database.lichess.org/) <br>
I also provided an evaluation file to test different models.
